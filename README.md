# Dataset: openaire-lod (development version)

[OpenAIRE LOD](https://web.archive.org/web/20201230151925/http://lod.openaire.eu/documentation) was a service that exported data from the OpenAIRE information space in RDF format, using Linked Open Data principles. The data was exported to Zenodo, with the [last dump dated at March 3, 2021](https://zenodo.org/records/4587369). This dataset consists of the "result" subset of the OpenAIRE LOD graph, including scientific results such as publications.

Only records that were valid RDF and had the "dateofcollection" property were included here. They were then sorted by the date of collection in ascending order. The first 2 (out of 28) million records that were obtained in this way are a part of this dataset.

See also [the project documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20201230151925/http://lod.openaire.eu/documentation) and [the used ontology](https://web.archive.org/web/20201230151925/http://lod.openaire.eu/vocab).

*This README is a snapshot of documentation for the latest development version of the dataset.
Full documentation for all versions can be found [on the website](https://w3id.org/riverbench/datasets/openaire-lod/dev).*

This class is suitable for annotating both theoretical uses and practical ones, i.e., real streams or datasets.  Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.  Note that 'stream type usage' is a subjective assertion and instances of this class may be annotated with additional provenance properties to explain who made the assertion. There can be multiple views on what type of stream is in use, depending on the involved actor, processing step, etc.">RDF stream type usage</abbr> ([stax:RdfStreamTypeUsage](https://w3id.org/stax/ontology#RdfStreamTypeUsage))
